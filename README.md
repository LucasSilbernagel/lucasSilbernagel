## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucas! I’m a Front-End Developer based in the Greater Toronto Area.

My specialties include:
  - Pixel-perfect design conversion from Photoshop, Sketch, PDF, and other formats into fully-functional user experiences
  - Conducting web accessibility reviews and implementing improvements to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
  - Custom theme development for WordPress and Shopify
  - Combining technical skills with bilingual (French) customer service experience to resolve web product issues for clients and users

In 2020 I graduated from web development bootcamp at Juno College, prior to which I earned a Master’s degree in sociocultural anthropology from the University of Toronto. My background in anthropology aligns perfectly with my interest in UX design; I love learning about people in order to make their lives easier!

I also have considerable experience working in sales and customer service, where I honed skills such as client management, technical troubleshooting, digital content management, and providing training to clients and colleagues.
