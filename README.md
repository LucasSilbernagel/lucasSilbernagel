## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucas! I’m on a mission to build websites and applications that can be enjoyed on any modern device and by any user, one line of code at a time!

I’m fluent in front-end web development tools including JavaScript (ES6), React, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Firebase, Git, APIs, and more.

My specialties include:
  - Pixel-perfect design conversion from Photoshop, Sketch, PDF, or other formats into fully-functional user experiences
  - Conducting web accessibility reviews and implementing improvements to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
  - Combining technical skills with bilingual (French) customer service experience to resolve web product issues for clients and users

I recently graduated from Juno College, prior to which I earned a Master’s degree in sociocultural anthropology from the University of Toronto. My background in anthropology aligns perfectly with my interest in UX design: I love learning about people in order to make their lives easier.

I also have considerable experience working in sales and customer service, where I honed skills such as client management, troubleshooting technical problems, updating content management systems, and training new teammates.

If you are interested in connecting with me, please get in touch!
